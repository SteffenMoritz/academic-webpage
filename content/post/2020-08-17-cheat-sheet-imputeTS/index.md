Maybe you already know the Cheat Sheets about R packages and R provided by RStudio and the community. Definitely worth a look:  https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ . There are many different cheats sheets provided for e.g. R Markdown, tidyverse, Rstudio, mlr and all kinds of R packages. They are a great resource to get an overview about the most common workflows and functions when working with a package.
The good news is - there is now also a Cheat Sheet available for the imputeTS package
([Check out the **imputeTS Cheat Sheet**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/imputeTS.pdf
