title: 'European R Users Meeting 2020 (eRUM) video online'
summary: Short talk about time series missing data visualizations now available on youtube.


---

It has been 2 month since the eRUM 2020 happend virtually. Now the conference talks are finally all available online as youtube videos. ([eRUM 2020 Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDOoQShiQHE7_C-wuLqFJ7w
))

A lot of really interesting talks to watch. It was a great conference (which was nearly cancled completely due to COVID-19). Huge props to the organizers, that basically organized two conferences - one in Italy, which was canceled and the virtual replacement two month later. I think the effort definitely payed off and it was quite a success!

I don't think I would have had nearly 300 viewers for my small lightning talk in the regular offline format.

Here you can have a look at my short talk 'Time Series Missing Data Visualizations':
