title: 'why R? Conference: Handling complex missing data problems in time series'
summary: why R Conference and own talk about time series imputation.


---

My talk about at why R? Conference 2020 about "Handling complex missing data problems in time series" has just finished. Luckily as it is with all these online conferences this year, the talk was streamed and is further available online for all who missed it. 

Overall whyR has so far been a great conference with plenty of different and interesting talks. Unfortunately I missed the workshops on Friday, but Saturday has been very interesting and I hope Sunday will be as well. I especially liked, that everything was streamed via Youtube, makes it quite comfortable to follow. Quite impressed, how well these onle formats are handled by the organisers. ([why R?
