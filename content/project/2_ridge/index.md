summary: R package for ridge regression with Automatic Selection of the Penalty Parameter. Initially developed by E. Cule, I was a regular package user at first. But I took over upkeep after it was dropped from CRAN, because it was missing a maintainer/did not pass the tests anymore. I fix bugs and perform small improvements on the package from time to time.
