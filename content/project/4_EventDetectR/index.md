summary: R package for detecting/classifiying events in time-series data. It aims to combine multiple well-known R-packages like the forecast package to deliver an easily configurable tool for event detection. The package originates from research projects at TH KÃ¶ln about anomaly detection in drinking water networks. I helped developing the package and still occasionally contribute code.
