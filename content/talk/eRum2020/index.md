abstract: Missing data is a quite common problem for time series, which usually also complicates later analysis steps. In order to deal with this problem, visualizing the missing data is a very good start. Visualizing the patterns in the missing data can provide more information about the reasons for the missing data and give hints on how to best proceed with the analysis. This talk gives a short intro into the new plotting functions being introduced with the 3.1 version of the imputeTS CRAN package.
