      <description>&lt;p&gt;My talk about at why R? Conference 2020 about &amp;ldquo;Handling complex missing data problems in time series&amp;rdquo; has just finished. Luckily as it is with all these online conferences this year, the talk was streamed and is further available online for all who missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall whyR has so far been a great conference with plenty of different and interesting talks. Unfortunately I missed the workshops on Friday, but Saturday has been very interesting and I hope Sunday will be as well. I especially liked, that everything was streamed via Youtube, makes it quite comfortable to follow. Quite impressed, how well these onle formats are handled by the organisers. (

&lt;p&gt;Here is my talk:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been 2 month since the eRUM 2020 happend virtually. Now the conference talks are finally all available online as youtube videos. (

&lt;p&gt;A lot of really interesting talks to watch. It was a great conference (which was nearly cancled completely due to COVID-19). Huge props to the organizers, that basically organized two conferences - one in Italy, which was canceled and the virtual replacement two month later. I think the effort definitely payed off and it was quite a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would have had nearly 300 viewers for my small lightning talk in the regular offline format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can have a look at my short talk &amp;lsquo;Time Series Missing Data Visualizations&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
