      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interestend in how the website was created:
I used an R package called blogdown - which uses hugo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/)&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/)&lt;/a&gt;. All development and changes were made in the RStudio IDE. I used the academic theme for hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website itself can also be found on my GitHub Repo. I can only recommend using this approach, since a website update is basically just a git commit. Hosting is free (it is on GitHub). Of course this only works for static websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got inspired to build this website by a workshop about &amp;lsquo;building a website with blogdown in R&amp;rsquo;
by Tatjana Kecojevic at European R Users Conference 2020 . Here is the material with a step to step guide: &lt;a href=&#34;https://websiteinr.netlify.app/&#34;&gt;https://websiteinr.netlify.app/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
